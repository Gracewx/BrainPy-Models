BrainPy-Models
===================

**Note**: *BrainPy-Models is a project under development.*
*More features are coming soon. Contributions are welcome.*


``BrainPy-Models`` is a repository accompany with `BrainPy <https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy>`_, which is a framework for spiking neural network simulation. With BrainPy, we implements the most cononical and effective neuron models and synapse models, and show them in ``BrainPy-Models``.

Here, users can learn examples of how to use BrainPy from `Documentations <https://brainpy-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and directly import our models into your network.
