BrainPy-Models documentation
===============================

``BrainPy-Models`` is based on `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ neuronal
dynamics simulation framework. Here you can find the list of all the models implemented in
BrainPy for neurons, synapses and topological networks.



.. note::

   We welcome your implementation about `neurons`, `synapses`, `learning rules`,
   `networks` and `paper examples`. https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy-Models
